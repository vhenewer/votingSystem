## DAO Classes

The DAO (Data Access Object) classes are responsible for interacting with the database. They provide methods for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and abstract the database logic from the rest of the application.

---

### BaseDao Class
The `BaseDao` class serves as the foundation for all DAO classes. It provides common methods for executing queries and managing database connections.

#### Attributes

#### Methods
- `execute_query(query: str, params=None)`: Executes a query (e.g., `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) with optional parameters and commits the transaction.
- `fetch_all(query: str, params=None)`: Executes a `SELECT` query and returns all results.
- `fetch_one(query: str, params=None)`: Executes a `SELECT` query and returns a single result.
- `close()`: Closes the database connection.

---

### UserDao Class
The `UserDao` class handles operations related to the `Users` table in the database. It inherits from `BaseDao`.

  Closes the login window.

- **`create_account()`**:  
  Creates a new user account by validating input fields and saving the user to the database.

### Notes
- The `Controller` class integrates with PyQt6 for GUI management.
- It uses DAO classes for database operations and the `Model` class for business logic.
